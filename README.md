# Object Oriented Programming
This is a project of OOP course for Ariel University.<br />
The assignment was to choose an app (We chose app that calls WiGLE WiFi Wardriving - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wigle.wigleandroid) that gives you information in a files about wifi with those data (Time, Lat, Lon, Alt, SSID, MAC, Frequency, Signal).<br />
and take those files and write them on one CSV file when the writing take action we need to organzied that all the wifi with the same coordinates (Lat, Lon, Alt) and time will be in the same line (time and coordinates that equal to time and coordinates in different line will be shown just once).<br />
The wifi will be order with higher signal. After creating the CSV file we need to take the time, coordintes and name of network from the new CSV and write them in Kml file, the Kml file we need to display on Google Earth App (https://www.google.com/earth/download/gep/agree.html) and it will present you all the wifi throw timeline.<br />
In addition, it is possible to Filter the information put data by - ID, Time, Position.<br />
Use 2 different Algorithms, One showing the approximate location of a specific MAC.<br />
The second displays the revalued location of the device identifier using 3 pairs of MAC & Signal.<br />
